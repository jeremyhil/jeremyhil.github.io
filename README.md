## A Website built with just GitHub's website and tools

This is a really great way to build a website. Just upload or create some HTML pages & images, then in settings turn on GitHub Pages.

### Editing & Updating
Edited with GitHub website, github.dev ( Just press the . ) or Codespaces

#### Publish the changes
After you commit the changes the workflow redeploys your site

#### Custom 404 page
To add a custom 404 page just create a 404.html in the repository

#### Adding a custom domain name
I added cname file, to see how long it takes to update but it Failed Needs to be CNAME
